Hello! Below are three plots analyzing the top artists on both Spotify and Youtube. I created these plots primarily to acclimate myself with the visualization of R using charts and plots, but I also analyzed the impact of various factors on a certain value in the data set. For instance, a song's licensing status could affect its stream count.I also did a general analysis of where the top artists lie on average in terms of their stream count.
